The project on yahoo hack day
We team aim at developing a simple app of android, which asociate the user with their accelerometer-equiped smartphone.
In daily life,the user's movement range can be measured and recorded by the accelerometer.With the real-time device accelerometer data,we could compute a value to measure the intensity of the user's activities.After getting the results of different users, we can provide diferrent suggestions of movement. In the future, we can collect the accelerometer data of lots of users.And the clustering method like K-MEANS can be imposed on the data set.As a result, we can compare the rythm of life between different users.
